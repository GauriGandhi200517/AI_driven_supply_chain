# Supply Chain Models Related to Data

## 1. Descriptive Models
- **Supply Chain Digital Twin**: Virtual replica of the supply chain leveraging real-time data for scenario analysis.
- **ABC Analysis Model**: Categorizes inventory based on data (e.g., revenue contribution, demand variability).
- **Demand Forecasting Models**: Use historical data and trends (e.g., ARIMA, Holt-Winters).

## 2. Predictive Models
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time-series data
- **Inventory Prediction Models**: Based on sales, weather, and seasonality data.
- **Demand Planning Models**: Leverage predictive analytics to forecast future demand.

## 3. Prescriptive Models
- **Optimization Models**:
  - Linear Programming (LP)
  - Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)
  - Network Flow Models
- **Inventory Optimization Models**: Balance holding costs with demand.
- **Transportation Optimization Models**: Minimize cost and time based on route data.

## 4. Data-Driven Frameworks
- **SCOR Model (Supply Chain Operations Reference)**: Maps and benchmarks supply chain processes with performance metrics.
- **Integrated Business Planning (IBP)**: Aligns supply chain data with financial and operational planning.
- **Control Tower Models**: Real-time visibility and analytics across the supply chain.

## 5. Simulation Models
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Assess risks and uncertainties in supply chain operations.
- **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)**: Simulates behaviors of individual supply chain entities using data.
- **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)**: Models supply chain dynamics over time.

## 6. Big Data and IoT Models
- **IoT-Enabled Supply Chain Models**: Use real-time sensor data for tracking and automation.
- **Big Data Analytics Models**: Analyze massive datasets for patterns and trends.
