1. Descriptive Models
**Supply Chain Digital Twin**: A virtual replica of the supply chain leveraging real-time data for scenario analysis.
ABC Analysis Model: Categorizes inventory based on data (e.g., revenue contribution, demand variability).
Demand Forecasting Models: Use historical data and trends (e.g., ARIMA, Holt-Winters).

2.** Predictive model related to machine learning **
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time-series data

3.**Inventory Prediction Models:** Based on sales, weather, and seasonality data.
Demand Planning Models: Leverage predictive analytics to forecast future demand.

4. Prescriptive Models
Optimization Models:
Linear Programming (LP)

5.Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)****
Network Flow Models
Inventory Optimization Models: Balance holding costs with demand.
Transportation Optimization Models: Minimize cost and time based on route data.

6. Data-Driven Frameworks
SCOR Model (Supply Chain Operations Reference): Maps and benchmarks supply chain processes with performance metrics.
Integrated Business Planning (IBP): Aligns supply chain data with financial and operational planning.
Control Tower Models: Real-time visibility and analytics across the supply chain.

8. Simulation Models
Monte Carlo Simulations: Assess risks and uncertainties in supply chain operations.
